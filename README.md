# Attendence-System-Students-App #
This is the Android App which the Professor would be using for generating OTP and accessing database containing information of Students' Attendance. UI for this app is in Beta Stage.

## Motivation behind developing this System ##
* To eliminate the problems of Proxy.
* Attendance process takes a lot of time when done manually.
* To eliminate the inefficient method of calculating attendance at the end of Semester Manually.

## Tools and Programming Languages used: ## 
Android Studio, Java, XML, Google Firebase

## How our code works ##
The professor generates a 4 digit random OTP, which is sent to Firebase Server and gets deleted after a specific time limit (10-20 seconds), and displays the generated OTP to the whole class. The student enters the shown OTP and once OTP gets matched their attendance is marked. Each professor and student has his/her own unique Login Ids.

## How this would eliminate the current existing problems ##
* Attendance is marked with a single touch taking hardly few seconds, thus marking Attendance is no longer a lengthy process. 
* Since there is a specific time limit for marking attendance by entering OTP, the problem of multiple Logins and sharing of OTP. Of course fastest fingers can cause a problem but we are trying to find a solution for eleminating that problem too (restricting the user from closing the app while marking Attendance).
* A database is created and displayed in the Professor's App containing attendance information of each and every student in the class thus eliminating the problem of Manual Labour.
